        MOD SDK</h2>
    <p>
        The Installer for the MOD SDK currently includes these pieces:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3DS Max plugins</li>
        <li>W3XViewer</li>
        <li>EALAModStudio</li>
        <li>Sample MOD</li>
        <li>Support documentation</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        3DS Max plugin</h4>
    <p>
        There are 2 sets of 3DS Max plugins included in this package. One requires that
        you have 3DS Max 9 and the other, 3DS Max 7 with service pack 1 or 3DS Max 8 installed.</p>
        <p>
        Note that 3DS Max 9 was used for the development of Red Alert 3, and is therefore the most likely
        to function correctly.  The 3DS Max 7 plugin was not used by the development team, but should still
        be fully functional.
        </p>
    <p>
        To install, copy the contents of "3dsmax7_plugin" found in your MOD SDK folder into
        their respective folders in the "3dsmax7" install directory. Similarly, copy the
        contents of &quot;3dsmax9_plugin&quot; into the respective folders for 3dsmax9.</p>
    <p>
        This will copy the actual plugin, several useful MaxScripts and shaders that can
        be used in Max to configure materials. See the 3DSMax section in the <a href="Documentation/Index.htm">
            documentation</a> for more info.</p>
    <h4>
        W3XViewer</h4>
    <p>
        The W3XViewer can be launched from anywhere, and does not need to be copied. If
        you have all your art files (W3X files and textures) in one directory W3XView can
        find them all together; however, the game file structure layout is different:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                W3X files, by default, need to be in a directory "Art\XX\" where XX is the first
                two letters of the file name. That directory needs to be below your installed MOD
                SDK directory. So a full path might be "C:\RA3 Mod SDK\Art\AB\AB_Conyard01.w3x&quot;</div>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Further Details on how art works can be found in the section detailing how the Sample
                    Mod was created in the <a href="Documentation/Index.htm">documentation</a>.</div>
            </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Typically our artists create W3X files and textures for one unit or&nbsp;structure
        in a single directory, and then copy over the final files into the W3X and texture
        directories that the game needs.</p>
    <h4>
        EALAModStudio</h4>
    <p>
        EALAModStudio is the replacement for the Buildmod.bat functionality from the C&C 3 Mod SDK.
        It is used to compile your mod into a form the game can read, and deploy it to the proper directory.
        In addition, EALAModStudio has the capability for users to add functionality to the mod compilation process.
        See the EALAModStudio documentation in the main SDK <a href="Documentation/Index.htm">documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Further documentation</h3>
    <p>
        Additional&nbsp;<a href="Documentation/Index.htm">documentation</a> in HTML format
        can be found in the Documentation directory. This includes documents about the various
        parts of the 3DS Max plug-in, the W3XViewer and further art creation rules (eg. how
        to set up house coloring). There is also the sections detailing how the Sample MOD
        was created.
