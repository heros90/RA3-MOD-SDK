	<h3>Building a Mod</h3>
<h4>Basic Explanation</h4>
<p>The final step in completing a mod is to build the data for the game.  Before you can use a mod, you will need to build the data.  Your
	tool for doing this is the Red Alert 3 Mod BuildStudio, located in your Mod SDK install directory as EALAModStudio.exe.  Red Alert 3 Mod BuildStudio is an application that will gather all of the proper files, run the Binary Asset Builder,
	and create the .big file of your mod, and install it in the proper location.  
</p>
<p>
When you first open Red Alert 3 Mod BuildStudio you will be confronted with a screen something like below:
</p>
<img src="images/modBuildStudio.png" alt="Red Alert 3 Mod BuildStudio" />
<p>
To build a mod, you can select the mod name from the dropdown in the upper left as shown:
</p>
<img src="images/modBuildSelect.png" alt="Selecting a mod to build" />
<p>To build your mod, you will want to make sure the following options are selected:
<ul>
<li>Build Data</li>
<li>Build Low LOD</li>
<li>Copy STR File</li>
<li>Make Big File</li>
<li>Copy Big File</li>
<li>Create SKUDEF</li>
</ul>
This is shown below:
</p>

<p>With those options selected, you can simply hit Build Mod, and the UI will handle building the mod.  
If an error occurs, you can find it in the Build output text box to the right, or use the Error Log on the Error Log tab.  Double clicking an
entry in the error log will take you to the line in the build output.
</p>
<h4>SKUDef File</h4>
<p>The Red Alert 3 Mod BuildStudio tool automates the SKUDef file generation.  The instructions below are for anyone who chooses not to use the tool.
<p>The SKUDef file tells the game how to launch the mod which you have built.  To set up the SKUDef file, navigate to your My Documents folder, choose the
	Red Alert 3 Folder, then the mods folder, and then the folder of the mod you just built.  Create a new file, and name it as follows:
	<span class="code">YourMod_1.0.skudef</span>
Inside the Skudef file, you will put the following text:</p>
<p class="code">mod-game 1.9<br />
add-big YourMod.big</p>
<p>This tells the game to launch the patch 1.09 version of the game, and to add the data from Your Mod into the game.</p>
<h4>Launching the Mod</h4>
<p>There are two ways to launch the game.  The easiest is to use the Mod Launcher which was included in Patch 1.09.  Start the Red Alert 3
Control Center, and select the Game Browser Button.  Navigate to the Mods Tab, select your mod, and hit Launch Game. </p>
<p class="important">Advanced Method</p>
<p>The second option, which is useful for creating a shortcut, is to use a command line option.  To do so, create a shortcut to RA3.exe, and add the following
	into the target:
</p>
<p class="code">-modConfig &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\Username\My Documents\Red Alert 3\mods\YourMod\YourMod_1.0.skudef&quot;</p>
	The modConfig command line option takes the full path to the skudef file for your mod.
