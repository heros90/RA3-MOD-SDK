			Compiling Maps
		</h3><p>
			Maps are compiled with the "BuildMap.bat." 
			This is a completely rewritten batch program to do more things automatically an minimize user actions like copying files manually etc.<br>
			The usage of the batch file with the available parameters is explained below.
		</p><p>
			<b>Usage</b><br>
			You can either just double-click the file and enter mapname and parameters manually or you can pass it through the commandline using this way:<br>
			BuildMap.bat [MapName [/cbc] [/csc] [/cbm] [/ma] [/nf]]
		</p><p>
			<b>Parameters</b><br>
			/cbc: Clear build cache<br>
			/csc: Clear session cache<br>
			/cbm: Clear built map<br>
			/ma: Merge assets<br>
			/nf: Do not fix assets
		</p><p>
			<b>MapName</b><br>
			The mapname is the folder name of your map in "%appdata%\Red Alert 3\Maps". The "map.xml" in this folder is the file that is being compiled. 
			If you want to add custom assets or modifications, include it to the "overrides.xml".
		</p><p>
			<b>Clear Build Cache</b><br>
			The build cache stores all compiled art and audio assets. 
			If you compile your map the first time the assets are copied to that cache. 
			If you now remove e.g. a model from your map and want to add it back later, it doesn't need to be compiled again. 
			It is copied from that cache which greatly reduces the duration of the whole compiling process.<br>
			Use this parameter if you want to clear the build cache.
		</p><p>
			<b>Clear Session Cache</b><br>
			The session cache stores all compiled assets of your previously compiled map. 
			If you now remove e.g. a model or any other asset from your map, it will be removed from that cache, too. 
			If you just change an asset, it will be compiled and updated in the cache and if nothing changed, the asset won't be compiled which saves time, too.<br>
			Use this parameter if you want to clear the session cache.
		</p><p>
			<b>Clear Built Map</b><br>
			All compiled and copied files go to "BuiltMods\Mods\Maps\[MapName]". The complete content (besides *.asset) will be copied back to 
			"%appdata%\Red Alert 3\Maps\[MapName]".<br>
			Use this parameter to delete all files from this folder.
		</p><p>
			<b>Merge Assets</b><br>
			Asset files that have been extracted with the C&C Asset Extractor can be reused in your map 
			without decompiling them. Asset and cdata files go to "%appdata%\Red Alert 3\Maps\[MapName]\Assets".<br>
			Use this parameter to merge these assets into the map stream.
		</p><p>
			<b>Do Not Fix Assets</b><br>
			If you use assets in your map that refer to data of the World Builder stream (e.g. civilian structures), 
			the models of these assets might become invisible ingame. This is being fixed when compiling the map.<br>
			Use this parameter to not fix these assets.
