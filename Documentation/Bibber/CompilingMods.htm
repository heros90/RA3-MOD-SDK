			Compiling Mods
		</h3><p>
			Mods are compiled using the Mod Studio with a list of options which I will explain in short.
		</p><p>
			<b>Clear Build Cache</b><br>
			The build cache stores all compiled art and audio assets. 
			If you compile your mod the first time the assets are copied to that cache. 
			If you now remove e.g. a model from your mod and want to add it back later, it doesn't need to be compiled again. 
			It is copied from that cache which greatly reduces the duration of the whole compiling process.<br>
			Tick this option if you want to clear the build cache.
		</p><p>
			<b>Clear Session Cache</b><br>
			The session cache stores all compiled assets of your previously compiled mod. 
			If you now remove e.g. a model or any other asset from your mod, it will be removed from that cache, too. 
			If you just change an asset, it will be compiled and updated in the cache and if nothing changed, the asset won't be compiled which saves time, too.<br>
			Tick this option if you want to clear the session cache.
		</p><p>
			<b>Clear Built Mod</b><br>
			All compiled files go to "BuiltMods\Mods\[ModName]". The complete content (besides *.asset) will be added to the mod's BIG file.<br>
			Tick this option to delete all files from this folder.
		</p><p>
			<b>Build AptUI</b><br>
			AptUI streams contain all the user interfaces. All files matching "Mods\[ModName]\Data\AptUI\*.xml" will be compiled.<br>
			Tick this option to compile the AptUI streams.
		</p><p>
			<b>Build Global Data</b><br>
			Global data is a bunch of assets that need to be loaded before all other stuff like models and textures. 
			For example, changes made to MPGameRules (starting cash etc.) only take effect when built as global data. 
			That means you have to create an xml file "Mods\[ModName]\Data\AdditionalMaps\MapMetaData_*.xml" 
			e.g. "Mods\[ModName]\Data\AdditionalMaps\MapMetaData_Mod.xml" which includes the assets.<br>
			Note: The naming has nothing to do with maps, it's merely a trick to get the data loaded as global.<br>
			Tick this option to compile the global data streams.
		</p><p>
			<b>Build Static Data</b><br>
			Static data is all the stuff like models, textures, GameObject assets etc. 
			The main file is "Mods\[ModName]\Data\Mod.xml" where all other assets have to be included, but do not include the xml files
			of your global data here!<br>
			Tick this option to compile the static data stream.
		</p><p>
			<b>Merge Assets</b><br>
			Asset files that have been extracted with the C&C Asset Extractor can be reused in your mod 
			without decompiling them. Asset and cdata files go to "Mods\[ModName]\Assets\[StreamName]". 
			For example, assets in "Mods\[ModName]\Assets\Mod" will be merged into the static stream of the mod.<br>
			Tick this options to merge these assets into the streams of the mod.
		</p><p>
			<b>Fix Assets</b><br>
			If you use assets in your mod that refer to data of the World Builder stream (e.g. civilian structures), 
			the models of these assets might become invisible ingame.<br>
			Tick this option to fix these assets.
		</p><p>
			<b>Create BIG Files</b><br>
			The BIG file is kind of a container that stores all files of your mod.
			There can be 2 BIG files, "[ModName]_[ModVersion]_Streams.big" for all your compiled streams and "[ModName]_[ModVersion]_Misc.big" 
			that holds all files of "Mods\[ModName]\Misc" which have nothing to do with the compiling process
			and just need to be added as they are.<br>
			Tick this option if you want the BIG files to be created automatically in "Documents\Red Alert 3\Mods\[ModName]".
		</p><p>
			<b>Create Skudef File</b><br>
			The Skudef file is a configuration file that holds the information what BIG files are loaded by the game. 
			This file is necessary for the mod to be recognized by the Game Browser.<br>
			Tick this option if you want the Skudef file to be created automatically in "Documents\Red Alert 3\Mods\[ModName]".
		</p><p>
			<b>Mod Version</b><br>
			Here you can set the version of your mod. The BIG and Skudef files' naming depends on it
			so the game can determine name and version of the mod.
