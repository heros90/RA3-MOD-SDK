	<h3>Common Issues</h3>
<h4>Red Alert 3 Mod BuildStudio crashes when running</h4>
<p>You likely do not have all of the <a href="required_apps.htm">Required Applications</a> installed.  
Make sure you have all of them installed, and then try running it again.</p>
<h4>My Mod doesn't show up in the Mod Launcher</h4>
<p>Make sure you have created the <a href="buildmod.htm">SKUDef File</a>, either manually, or using the Create SKUDEF option in BuildStudio. Instructions can be found in the <a href="buildmod.htm">Building a Mod</a> section.
</p>
<h4>My Mod crashes while the game is loading</h4>
<p>If your mod name is longer than 15 characters the game will crash on startup.  If your mod name is too long, rename it to something shorter.
</p>
<h4>When overriding an existing unit, Binary Asset Builder shows a large number of errors about missing files</h4>
<p>This is normal, and is not in fact a problem.  Binary Asset Builder cannot find the source files for the art, but they are not needed.  Your unit
	should work fine in the game.
</p>
<h4>Binary Asset Builder crashes with a critical error with information about an XML Validation error</h4>
<p>You have likely specified an invalid tag, attribute, or otherwise have malformed your XML.  Check the file and area that it suggests in the area
	and look for issues.  Check the schema files for the module or Asset, and make sure that you are using valid attributes.  In addition, make sure that
	your closing tags properly match, and  any tags which do not require a separate closing tag end in /&gt;
</p>
<h4>3DSMax Crashes when I attempt to export my model</h4>
<p>If you are using shaders with multiple textures, make sure that you have supplied a valid texture for all of them.  It is likely that not having
	one specified will cause 3DSMax to crash.
</p>
<h4>Custom objects don't show up on my map created using a mod</h4>
<p>The mod you used to create the map is not running.  Objects which are missing will not cause the game to crash, but they simply will not appear.  Exit
	the game and make sure that you launch it with your mod, and then try running the map again.
</p>
<h4>I can't use existing Civilian buildings, or override them in my mod</h4>
<p>This is a known issue with this version of the Mod SDK.  Due to the way that the map specific assets (civilian structures, props, etc)
	are loaded, they are not able to be referenced by the Mod SDK, and therefore cannot be used.
</p>
<h4>I can't find the DirectX Shader Option to apply materials in 3DS Max</h4>
<p>Ensure that 3DS Max is in DirectX display mode.  You can change the display mode via the Change Graphics Mode shortcut in the 3DS Max folder in the Start Menu.  Set it to DirectX 9.</p>
<h4>I've edited a faction building or unit, and it is now invisible</h4>
<p>It is possible that the manifest files for the existing units and structures were overwritten or deleted.  Check the BuiltMods\Sagexml folder, and ensure that
	static.manifest, global.manifest, and audio.manifest are located there.  In addition, make sure that the structure or unit is contained within those two manifests.
	The easiest way to do so is search through the files that include the file it is declared in, and see if either static.xml or global.xml contains a reference.
	If it is referenced from either of those files, it should be possible to use the art from that object.  If it is not, it is likely in the worldbuilder.manifest,
	and due to SDK limitations, not usable (see the Civilian buildings issue above).
