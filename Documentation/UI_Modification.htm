	<h3>UI Modification</h3>
<h4>Limitations of UI Modification</h4>
<p>Due to limitations of the tools included in the SDK, modification of the UI beyond texture replacement is not possible.
</p>
<h4>Directory Organization</h4>
<p>Within the data directory for your mod, you need to create an AptUI folder.  This folder will contain the modified UI screens.  You can simply copy the directory for the UI screen you wish to modify into the AptUI folder
	of your mod.  In the RA3 Mod SDK the UI modification process has been simplified.  As long as the folder for the UI screen is in the AptUI folder, the SDK build tool will take care of everything else which was manual in the C&amp;C 3 Mod SDK.
