        Sage Engine</font></h3>
    <p>
        Red Alert 3 was created using Electronic Art’s (EA) Sage Engine.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The Sage Engine utilizes 3DSMax as its main application for creating art.&nbsp;
        There are&nbsp;4 main tools that are used in 3DSMax: .W3X Exporter, w3d Skin modifier,
        w3d utilities and w3d materials. These are generally referred to as the W3D tools.</p>
    <p>
        The W3X viewer allows the user to view the W3X files exported from max before bringing
        them in-game.</p>
    <p>
        The Sage Engine also uses WorldBuilder, which is a proprietary application for
        the creation of single-player and multiplayer maps for the game. An updated version
        of WorldBuilder is required for creating maps which depend on content in a Red Alert
        3 mod, and can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.commandandconquer.com/" target="_blank">
            Command and Conquer.com</a></p>
    <p>
        The Red Alert 3 Mod SDK requires certain applications to be installed for it to
        function properly. Please view the <a href="Required_Apps.htm" target="main">Required
            Applications page</a> for more information.</p>
    <p>
        The Red Alert 3 Mod SDK makes use of ANTLR v2.0 and MVP.XML. Please click <a href="Copyright.htm"
